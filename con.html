        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <!-- Content for the Conclusion page goes here -->
        <p>Based on the specific requirements of our project, which involve handling a large dataset and performing complex analytical tasks, BigQuery emerges as the preferred choice. Its scalability, fast query execution, and efficient handling of large datasets make it well-suited for our project's needs. Additionally, its distributed architecture enables parallel processing, ensuring quick analysis without the need for extensive infrastructure setup. While there may be associated costs based on usage, the performance benefits of BigQuery justify the investment, particularly for enterprise-level analytics projects like ours where speed and scalability are crucial.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, based on the results obtained from time series forecasting with ARIMA and the estimation of storage costs, several recommendations and conclusions can be drawn:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usefulness of Tool:</strong> The ability to perform time series forecasting using ARIMA allows for predicting future sales trends, which is valuable for business planning and decision-making. The estimation of storage costs provides insights into the potential expenses associated with storing data in BigQuery, enabling better budget allocation and cost management.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility and Practicality:</strong> BigQuery emerges as a highly useful tool for handling large volumes of data efficiently. Its scalability and robustness make it suitable for organizations dealing with substantial datasets, enabling seamless data processing and analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Consideration:</strong> While BigQuery offers impressive capabilities, its pricing structure must be carefully considered. Storage costs can accumulate, especially for sizable datasets, and may vary depending on factors such as data volume, storage duration, and region. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor and optimize storage usage to mitigate expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Value vs. Cost:</strong> Despite the potential costs associated with BigQuery, its value proposition lies in the ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets quickly. Organizations willing to invest in data-driven decision-making can find BigQuery to be a worthwhile investment, as it facilitates analytics, forecasting, and business intelligence tasks effectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In conclusion, the tool provides valuable capabilities for data analysis, forecasting, and cost estimation, making it a useful asset for organizations seeking to derive actionable insights from their data. However, organizations should carefully evaluate the cost-effectiveness of storing data in BigQuery and consider their specific analytical needs before deciding to use the tool.</p>
